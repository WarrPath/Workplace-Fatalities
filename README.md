# Workplace-Fatalities
Exploratory data analysis report about workplace fatalities using Power BI.

# Requirements
1. Summarize descriptive statistics about the data, including at least one descriptive visualization, such as a box-and-whisker plot or histogram displaying the distribution of a variable.
2. Contains an interactive element that lets a user cut into the data, e.g., a slicer
3. Generates interesting questions about the data and explores those questions with two or more visualizations that highlight an insight about the data, possibly applying transformations to the data. For example, a scatter or line plot showing the relationship between two variables.
4. Effectively uses of analytical storytelling to convey insight(s), including good practices for visualizations

The report should answer the following questions:
1. Which program, state or federal, has the highest rate of fatalities?
2. Which state with a state program has the highest number of injuries/illnesses?
3. What is the relationship, if any, between “Average of Years to Inspect Each Workplace Once” and “Rate of Fatalities”?
